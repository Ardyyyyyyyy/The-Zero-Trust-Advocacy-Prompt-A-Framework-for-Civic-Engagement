### Philosophy: Why "Zero Trust"?

Have you ever felt powerless against a bureaucratic wall? Have you been given the runaround, had your voice ignored, or been stymied by a system that seems designed to exhaust you? This project was born from such an experience.

The "Zero Trust" approach is the core philosophy of this tool. It is not about cynicism or hostility. It is a strategic framework built on a simple, powerful principle: **Trust no one's goodwill; verify everything with evidence.**

This prompt helps you stop hoping for the system to be fair and start compelling it to be accountable. It replaces hope with strategy, emotion with logic, and anecdotal complaints with irrefutable evidence.

### How It Works

This is not just a template. It is an interactive consultation process designed to be used with advanced AI assistants like Gemini. The process unfolds in three phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Interactive Consultation:** The AI acts as your strategic consultant, asking targeted questions to extract the crucial details of your situation.
2.  **Phase 2: Strategic Document Generation:** Based on your input, the AI generates precisely tailored, powerful documents for all the stakeholders you need to engage.
3.  **Phase 3: Action Plan Delivery:** The AI provides a step-by-step strategic plan on how to use these documents for maximum impact.

### How to Use
